        It’s surprising that something as complex as reality should be conveyed by something as creative as language in such a predictable way. Every person you will ever meet, despite of being born and brought up in completely different environment and situation than yours. Speaking a completely different language than yours. Maybe of a different gender and ethnicity than yours, despite of all these differences, will express themselves in an exact same pattern as you will. If that doesn’t blow your mind, you have no emotions.
